## Course Information and Policies

Stat 140 introduces students to probability theory using both mathematics and computation, the two main tools of the subject. Though Berkeley has outstanding probability courses (e.g. Stat 134, EE 126), none of them uses computation for problem solving. Stat 140 is an attempt to teach probability in a manner better suited for students in the 21st century.

The list of topics has considerable overlap with existing probability courses, though the selection emphasizes topics useful for data science. The main difference is the consistent use of Jupyter notebooks running Python, both by the instructor and the students, building on foundations laid in Data 8. The power of computing will allow students to solve problems that are intractable by calculator and are thus avoided in courses like Stat 134. Computation (numerical and symbolic), simulation, and graphics will give students a firmer grasp of the concepts than math alone, and will also develop an appreciation for the power of the math.
