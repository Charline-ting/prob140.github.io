The development of Prob 140 has been a team effort by faculty and students.

Dibya Ghosh and Jason Zhang were central to course development, including course infrastructure, the prob140 Python library, the building and features of the interactive online textbook, computational and pedagogical aspects of several labs, quizzes, and overall pedagogy. They were also the Lead UGSIs (Undergraduate Student Instructors) in the initial offerings of the course. 

Max Weinstein completed the UGSI team in the pilot offering and worked on several labs. Kazu Kogachi and Mujahid Zaman were part of the course staff as tutors and UGSIs since it was first offered.

Discussion section structure and content owes much to Dibya Ghosh, Biyonka Liang, and Katherine Yen.

All aspects of the class have been improved by the creativity and dedication of long-time Lead UGSI Alan Chuang.

The textbook was rebuilt in Summer 2018 by Dominic Croce based on infrastructure created by Chris Holdgraf. It was rebuilt again in Summer 2020 by Ryan Roggenkemper based on new Jupyter Books infrastructure created by Chris Holdgraf and others.

The course logo, by Biyonka Liang, was the winning entry in a competition among students and staff in the pilot offering.

Prob 140 has had outstandingly dedicated and creative staff teams. Apart from those mentioned above, the initial offerings were fortunate to have the contributions of Priyanka Bhoj, Alan Chuang, Arvind Iyengar, Serena Jiang, Tara Mirmira, Xinyi Ren, and Henry Zhu.
