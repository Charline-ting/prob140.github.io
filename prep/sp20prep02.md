title: Preparation Guide for Weeks 3 and 4
---

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###

The course follows the textbook in sequence. So you will always know which chapters are going to be covered: start where you left off in the previous week, and compare the [home page calendar](http://prob140.org/) with the [Table of Contents](http://prob140.org/textbook/README) to see where to stop.

#### Week 3 ####
**Required Reading:** Textbook Chapters 7 and 8

**Additional Reading:** Pitman Section 2.1, 2.4, 2.5

#### Week 4 ####
**Required Reading:** Textbook Chapters 8 and 9  

**Additional Reading:** Pitman Section 3.2

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

Each Review Set has two parts: The Basics and Additional Practice. Start with the basics, then do as many as you can from the Additional Practice list. You might not have time to get to them all. That's OK â€“ if you have been practicing coming up with solutions yourself, you should be able to tackle new problems on tests.
