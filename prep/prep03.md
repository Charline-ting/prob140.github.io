## Week 3 Preparation Guide ##

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook Chapters 6 and 7

**Highly recommended:** Pitman Section 2.1, 2.4, 2.5. Poissonization is covered in 3.5 in the context of the Poisson random scatter, which is why it's not on this list.

### Practice Problems ###
Pitman x.y.z means Exercise z of Section x.y and x.rev.z means Exercise z of the Review Exercises at the end of Chapter x.

This is a longer list than usual because several of the exercises are quick. Use `stats` to get numerical values.
- Pitman 2.1.7, 2.1.12
- Pitman 2.4.6, 2.4.9; in both problems, compare the exact binomial probability and its Poisson approximation 
- Pitman 2.5.8, 2.5.9
- Pitman 2.rev.10, 2.rev.18
- In the problems from Pitman 3.5, use the Poisson distribution throughout. If it’s being used as an approximation to the binomial, you know how to find the parameter. If it’s being used as the distribution of the number of points in a region, set the parameter to be “size of region times rate of points per unit size”. You’ll see that this is not complicated. Do 3.5.9, 3.5.12, 3.5.14 (ignore means and SDs for now), 3.5.18.
