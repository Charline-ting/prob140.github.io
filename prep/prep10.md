title: Week 10 Preparation Guide
---

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
The course follows the textbook in sequence. So you will always know which chapters are going to be covered: start where you left off in the previous week, and compare the [home page calendar](http://prob140.org/) with the [Table of Contents](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/README) to see where to stop.

Lectures will cover Chapters 16 and 17 this week.

**Highly Recommended:** Pitman Sections 4.4, 5.2 (especially the facing-pages spread on pages 348-349), and 4.6


### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

Each Review Set has two parts: The Basics and Additional Practice. Please do all the problems on the Basics list below. Then do as many as you can from the Additional Practice list. You might not have time to get to them all. That's OK â€“ if you have been practising coming up with solutions yourself, you should be able to tackle new problems on tests. 


[Review Set 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/05_Review_Problems_Set_4) is based on the material of Chapters 16 through 18. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well.

- The Basics: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Additional Practice: 11, 13b, 17, 19


### Sections ###

[Review Set 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/05_Review_Problems_Set_4) 1, 3, 5, 13a, 14

### Scope for Quiz 2 ###
Quiz 2 on Wednesday 11/6 corresponds to Chapters 12-14.

Please study the logic and methods of calculation involved in the exercises in Homeworks 7 and 8, and the exercises in Review Set 3.

Problems will not be clones of exercises in homework or review sets but will be closely related to them. Quizzes will not involve reading or writing code.
