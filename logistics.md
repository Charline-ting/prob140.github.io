title: Prob 140 Course Information, Fall 2020
---

**A. Adhikari**

Welcome to a most unusual semester. We hope to make it a good one in Prob 140 in spite of all the strangeness!

This page contains the nitty-gritty details of the class. Please read it carefully, and also read the companion page [about](/about.md) the class.

Enrolled and waitlisted students should be sure to join our **Piazza** forum. We will open Piazza for questions about logistics and math prerequisites well before classes start. It will also contain information about Prof. Adhikari's pre-semester live sessions.

Please expect to hear from us about a **reorganization of section times** to accommodate students in different time zones. This information will also be posted on Piazza.

## Online Education ##

Since we are going to be off campus for a while, our goal is to provide good online education till we can convene again in person. That's quite different from trying to reproduce in-person classes on Zoom. In essence, the difference is that we aren't constrained by fixed-length class meetings. Instead, we will provide you with the material at the start of each week, and you get to decide how and when you will study so that you can complete it by deadline.

That's a lot of freedom for you, but that much freedom can feel a bit scary. So we're going to be there five days a week to work with you and help you stay on track, as you will see below. We also hope to support you in finding your Prob 140 academic community, a.k.a. study partners, sounding boards, and fellow sufferers.

You will be just fine provided you maintain the discipline of working regularly and communicating as much as possible with course staff and your fellow students. That can be hard to do when you're not at school surrounded by other students. So we'll be looking for ways to help you stay connected and productive, beyond those that we've already planned. Use Piazza to tell us what works best for you.

## Technology ##

You will need:

- a laptop or desktop computer with a camera, and a browser such as Chrome or Safari for running Zoom and accessing Jupyterhub, Gradescope, etc.
- Reliable wifi
- Preferably also a smartphone with a camera

If you think you might have difficulties with some of these, please let us know. You can apply for [help](https://technology.berkeley.edu/STEP) from campus even though the priority deadline has passed.

But this is primarily a math class, so your main tools for working will be paper and pencil or a tablet equivalent.

## Required Text ##

[*Probability for Data Science*](http://prob140.org/textbook) by Ani Adhikari and Jim Pitman.

All of the course content apart from the assignments is in the textbook. This term, **short video segments are being distributed throughout the book**, as well as quick exercises that you can do to check your understanding.

The videos will cover selected portions of the written text, typically those that require detailed calculation or discussion. There's more in the written text that you should read or at least skim. In fact, you can learn the material by studying only the written text, as many students have done in the past.

Whichever you primarily use – video or written text – you will learn best by working out the calculations yourself as you watch or read, and by trying the Quick Check questions.

There are exercises at the end of each chapter. Do as many of them as you can. You will soon see why they are important.

## Study Guides ##

Weekly content and assignments will be released on Mondays. You should use the weekly Study Guide to map out your work. It will provide you with a detailed outline of the week's main ideas with links to the textbook, a schedule that describes the focus of the instructor's live sessions and those held by the GSIs, a list of recommended practice problems, and so on.

Each week's assignments are based on the material of that week, not of the previous week. The week's content, live sessions, practice problems, homework, and lab are carefully coordinated. The Study Guide is designed to help you distribute your work effectively over the week. Leaving it till the weekend is not a good idea.

## Attendance ##

The class has been set up so that in principle you can complete it successfully without attending any live session other than the exams. However, this approach is not recommended unless you are very competent at abstract math. For some perspective, all the students who excelled in past semesters participated regularly. This is not a bingeable class.

A typical week will include the following live sessions, all of which are optional but highly recommended. Live sessions are for conversation, which is the way to figure out how to start working independently with probabilistic ideas.

All sessions below start on "Berkeley time", which in this case doesn't mean the time zone but our cherished practice of starting 10 minutes after the listed time.

- Instructor's Hour, which is actually closer to 80 minutes, 12:30 p.m. to roughly 2 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Study Guide will show what you are supposed to have read or skimmed ahead of time. The sessions will consist of another look at the content (already available as video and text in the textbook) and Q&A about the details. You should bring questions for the instructor, and the instructor will have questions for you.
- GSI's Hour, twice weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays at various times. These will be conversations on problem-solving, extensions of video walkthroughs of exercises that will be available ahead of time. Discussions will cover how to select appropriate methods, similarities and differences with other exercises, etc.
- Homework parties, days and times TBA
- Lab party, day and time TBA
- Instructor, GSI, and tutor office hours, both open and one-on-one, days and times TBA

Starting after September 4 (the add/drop deadline) we will offer some weekly small-group tutoring sections for students who could use a bit of extra support. Availability and sign-up information will be provided. **Students who join these sections will be required to attend**.

Informal conversation will be encouraged during all live sessions, so they will not be recorded.

## The Required Components of Your Work ##

**All dates, days, and times are local to Berkeley**. If you are in a different time zone it is your responsibility to convert them correctly. Remember that you might be off by a day depending on your location.

All work must be submitted on Gradescope. Please follow all submission instructions. Not doing so will result in no credit and no regrade request allowed for the work. It is your responsibility to make sure your submission is complete.

### Weekly Assignments ###

Each week's assignments will be released on Monday as part of the week's course material. There might be some changes in release dates or due dates because of exams and holidays. We'll let you know.

**Late assignments will not be accepted**. But if you have university accommodations for extended time on assignments, we will contact you during the first week of classes to make your arrangements.
All assignments will be graded for correctness. There is plenty of support available while you work on them, so if you get started early and use the support you should be able to turn in work that you understand well and know to be correct. That's by far the most efficient way to succeed in the class.

- **Checkpoint** consists of two straightforward exercises on the first half of the week's content. These will not involve computing and will be done on paper. The checkpoint assignment is due by 11:59 pm on Wednesday of the same week.
- **Homework** typically involves both math and computing, which you will do in Jupyter notebooks and on paper. Homework is due by 11:59 pm on Monday of the following week.
- **Lab** typically involves both math and computing, which you will do in Juypter notebooks and on paper. Some labs will be completed in one week and some in two, but there will be lab work due every week. Lab (or Part A if it is a two-week lab) is due by 11:59 on Monday of the following week. If the lab has a Part B, that will be due by 11:59 pm on Monday one week after Part A. You may do your lab with one other student in the class, and are strongly encouraged to take this option. Instructions for finding a lab partner and submitting with your partner will be provided.

### Exams ###

- **Midterm 1** on Friday September 25, 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and **Midterm 2** on Friday October 30, 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.. Other details about the midterms will be announced by September 1. You should expect that there will be numerous different versions of the exams.
- **Final Exam** on Friday December 18, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., Exam Group 17. This exam will be proctored remotely. Details will be announced by September 1.

The final exam is required for a passing grade. Please make sure that you are not enrolled in a class that has a conflicting final exam. If you have extended time accommodations for exams, please make sure that you have enough hours on the morning of Friday 12/18 for the 140 final.

We are aware that there are students in different time zones and that some students have extended time accommodations. Please hold your questions until we announce the details. Thank you!
 
## Grades ##

In the calculation of your overall score, we will drop:

- your two lowest homework scores
- your two lowest checkpoint scores 

No labs will be dropped.

Course grades will be based on your overall score in the class, calculated using the following weights:

- Checkpoint 5%
- Homework 20%
- Labs 15%
- Midterm 1 10%
- Midterm 2 15%
- Final 35%

[Berkeleytime](https://www.berkeleytime.com/grades/0-14539-all-adhikari,-a) has the letter grade distributions from past semesters. Because of the default P/NP grading in Spring 2020, you might just want to look at [Fall 2019](https://www.berkeleytime.com/grades/1-14539-fall-2019-adhikari,-a-_-1) as a more typical semester.

## Collaboration and Integrity ##

You are encouraged to discuss practice problems, homework, and labs with your fellow students and with course staff. Arguing with friends about exercises is an excellent and time-honored way to learn. However, you must write up your all own assignments and code by yourself; for labs, this can be in collaboration with your group.

Copying assignments from other sources is not only dishonest, it also doesn’t help anyone. Each exercise requires its own combination of ideas, and each student needs practice in coming up with those combinations, or else they will be at a loss when trying to use probability theory in their future work. From a purely practical perspective, all students must work independently on Prob 140 exams – no collaboration allowed. If a test is the first time a student works independently, then the test is not likely to go well.

Prob 140 materials including exams and solutions are the intellectual property of the course developers. From the campus statement on [Academic Integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/statements-course-policies): "... students may not circulate or post materials (handouts, exams, syllabi,–any class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor."

I am extremely tough with dishonest students and I hope that I will not be put in that situation in this class. I expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.
