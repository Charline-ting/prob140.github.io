## Course Information and Policies

Stat 140 introduces students to probability theory using both mathematics and computation, the two main tools of the subject. Though Berkeley has outstanding probability courses (e.g. Stat 134, EE 126), none of them uses computation for problem solving. Stat 140 is an attempt to teach probability in a manner better suited for students in the 21st century.

The list of topics has considerable overlap with existing probability courses, though the selection emphasizes topics useful for data science. The main difference is the consistent use of Jupyter notebooks running Python, both by the instructor and the students, building on foundations laid in Data 8. The power of computing will allow students to solve problems that are intractable by calculator and are thus avoided in courses like Stat 134. Computation (numerical and symbolic), simulation, and graphics will give students a firmer grasp of the concepts than math alone, and will also develop an appreciation for the power of the math.


## Course Format

The course includes many events: lecture, lab, discussions,  office hours, and review sessions. Weekly labs, discussions, and lecture are typically the most valuable events to attend.

Lecture: The course includes two 80-minute lectures per week.

Discussion: The course includes one 50 minute discussion section this week. Run by GSIs (Graduate Student Instructors), these help teach the core concepts and theory in the class. Although attendance in discussion is not mandatory, there are bi-weekly quizzes to ensure that everyone keeps up with the materials.

Lab: The course includes one laboratory section each week. These sections are run by an amazing group of Graduate Student Instructors. Getting to know your GSI is an excellent way to succeed in this course. Participation in lab is required.

Office Hours: Attending office hours is another excellent way to succeed in this course. Office hours are held by GSIs and the instructor each week. A schedule appears on the staff page of the course website.

In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on assignments, and work with peers and course staff in a small group setting.

## Materials

The primary text for this course is an online textbook, which consists of lecture note style presentations on topics. There are two *(optional)* textbooks which may help

- **Probability** by Jim Pitman, Springer New York; the standard text for Stat 134
- **Introduction to Probability** by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific; a text for EE 126
