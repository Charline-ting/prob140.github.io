### What is Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 (formally Statistics 140 or STAT 140)  is a probability course for undergraduates who have taken Data 8, have a math background, and wish to go deeper into the theory of data science.

The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data 8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Prob 140 capitalizes on this. Because of the students' backgrounds, Prob 140 will move swiftly over basics, avoid approximations that are unnecessary when SciPy is at hand, and replace some of the routine calculus by symbolic math done in SymPy. This will create time to focus on the more demanding concepts that are part of the theoretical foundations of data science.

Prob 140 is a course in probability theory, not data analysis. The course aims to give students a good theoretical background for modern data analysis. Contents have been selected based on consultation with faculty who regularly teach Stat and CS courses in advanced statistical topics including machine learning. Specifically, Prob 140 is intended to provide good preparation for CS 189 and Stat 154, with the goal that students should be able to move from Prob 140 to a machine learning class without necessarily having to take a semester of theoretical statistics in between.

The class requires more mathematics than Stat 134, the Statistics department’s standard course in classical probability theory; in addition to calculus, Prob 140 requires linear algebra. Computational power in Prob 140 allows students to solve problems that are intractable by other methods. Students also explore the standard mathematical theory graphically and by simulation, and thus develop a more firm grasp of the concepts than they might by using math alone.

### What requirements does Prob 140 satisfy? ###

Prob 140 satisfies the [probability requirement](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/upper-division) for the Data Science major. Prob 140 is one of the two probability classes that are preferred as preparation for the new data science class Stat 102, *Data Inference, and Decisions*. 

For the Statistics major and minor, and for Statistics courses numbered 135 and above, Prob 140 satisfies the same requirements as Stat 134 does. If a Statistics course currently requires Stat 134, then Prob 140 will fulfill that requirement too. A letter grade of B- or better in Prob 140 will satisfy the corresponding Stat 134 grade requirement for entry into the Statistics major.

Prob 140 satisfies the statistics requirement for entry into the Economics major, and elective requirements for some non-Stat majors. Students can petition others. Please direct your inquiries to the other major and include the link to the [Prob 140 website](http://prob140.org/) if needed.

### Who can take Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 is restricted to undergraduates who:

- Have not taken Stat 134; only one of Stat 134 and Prob 140 can be taken for credit
- Have taken a year of calculus at the level of Math 1A-1B and preferably higher; Prob 140 involves some double integration and partial derivatives
- Have taken or are concurrently taking linear algebra in Math 54 or EE 16A or Stat 89A or Math 110, or have taken an equivalent linear algebra course at another college
- Have taken Data 8 or Data 100 or **both** Stat 20 and CS 61A

All of the requirements are enforced because the course has been designed specifically for students who have the above background in math, programming, and statistical inference. Students who have the math and programming background but not the inference are encouraged to consider EECS 126.  

### What is the best way to succeed in Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 is an upper division course that is primarily mathematical. Students are expected to have a corresponding degree of academic independence, discipline, and mathematical fluency. 

In all my courses I aim to make learning as efficient and enjoyable as possible. In particular, I try to make the lectures a great way to learn the material. So show up (there will be no videos) and ask lots of questions. A preparation guide is provided each week; it lists the reading and practice that students should do before attempting the week's assignments. These lists aren't just decoration. They are designed to be helpful. Homework will go faster if you've done the reading and some practice first.

But rather than reading more advice from me, listen to your fellow students instead. Here are quotes from student evaluations of the Spring 2019 course. They are from answers to the question "What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?" On the first day of class I show all of the responses to this question so you can see that the subset below is representative.

- ATTEND LECTURE! Be ready to put in a lot of work for this course. Despite being challenging, this course is incredibly rewarding.
- Do practice problems and don't do the assignments last minute.
- Is the textbook required reading? (For 140 the answer is YES YES YES YES YES. The textbook is your new bible. Study it.) Is lecture/discussion worth going. (The answer is again YES YES YES!!!!!!!!! ... Your choice: spend an hour or so in lec/discussion vs spending double or triple amount of time on your own trying to understand the material)
- If you take this class properly and actually keep up with the lectures, it's incredibly fascinating. One important thing to note is that as we are (mostly) technical majors, this isn't one of those classes you can just binge watch lectures for at the end of the semester. This class *requires* time every week, especially for lab and hw. It'll be an amazing, fulfilling class if you do take it seriously, but you'll just have regret and be annoyed at yourself if you don't.
- I went into the class not knowing anyone but met an amazing study group in office hours and wouldn't have been able to do the class without them. With that said, if you do end up working with other people make sure that you're all challenging each other and asking questions until you all are on the same page. It doesn't help anyone if you pretend to understand what's going on when you really don't and it will show in your performance in the class. Do the work and the results will follow.
-  If you are an average student like me you NEED this class. This course can change the way you learn and think. Do not be afraid ... The pace is demanding ... but in the middle of the semester you will change. Things will start to "click" and it is indescribable how satisfying it is.
- Make sure that you conceptually understand the homework/labs. (and don't just do them for the grade)
- Each assignment/question serves a purpose. Whether it is to build a foundation or reveal an interesting idea. ... Understanding and doing each assignment is vital to get the most out of the course.
- This class is what you make of it: if you work hard and consistently and honestly, you will LOVE this class, but if you slack off, you will not have a good time.
- I personally think this is one of the most important, well– developed classes Berkeley has to offer ...
- Trust me. The time you spend on this course is time well spent.
