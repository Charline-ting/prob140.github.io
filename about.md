### What is Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 (formally Statistics 140 or STAT 140)  is a probability course for undergraduates who have taken Data 8, have a math background, and wish to go deeper into the theory of data science.

The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data 8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Prob 140 capitalizes on this. Because of the students' backgrounds, Prob 140 will move swiftly over basics, avoid approximations that are unnecessary when SciPy is at hand, and replace some of the routine calculus by symbolic math done in SymPy. This will create time to focus on the more demanding concepts that are part of the theoretical foundations of data science.

Prob 140 is a course in probability theory, not data analysis. The course aims to give students a good theoretical background for modern data analysis. Contents have been selected based on consultation with faculty who regularly teach Stat and CS courses in advanced statistical topics including machine learning. Specifically, Prob 140 is intended to provide good preparation for CS 189 and Stat 154, with the goal that students should be able to move from Prob 140 to a machine learning class without necessarily having to take a semester of theoretical statistics in between.

The class requires more mathematics than Stat 134, the Statistics department’s standard course in classical probability theory; in addition to calculus, Prob 140 requires linear algebra. Computational power in Prob 140 allows students to solve problems that are intractable by other methods. Students also explore the standard mathematical theory graphically and by simulation, and thus develop a more firm grasp of the concepts than they might by using math alone.

### What requirements does Prob 140 satisfy? ###

Prob 140 satisfies the [probability requirement](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/upper-division) for the Data Science major. Prob 140 is one of the two probability classes that are preferred as preparation for the new data science class Stat 102, *Data Inference, and Decisions*. 

For the Statistics major and minor, and for Statistics courses numbered 135 and above, Prob 140 satisfies the same requirements as Stat 134 does. If a Statistics course currently requires Stat 134, then Prob 140 will fulfill that requirement too. A letter grade of B- or better in Prob 140 will satisfy the corresponding Stat 134 grade requirement for entry into the Statistics major.

Prob 140 satisfies the statistics requirement for entry into the Economics major, and elective requirements for some non-Stat majors. Students can petition others. Please direct your inquiries to the other major and include the link to the [Prob 140 website](http://prob140.org/) if needed.

### Who can take Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 is restricted to undergraduates who:

- Have not taken Stat 134; only one of Stat 134 and Prob 140 can be taken for credit
- Have taken a year of calculus at the level of Math 1A-1B and preferably higher; Prob 140 involves some double integration and partial derivatives
- Have taken or are concurrently taking linear algebra in Math 54 or EE 16A or Stat 89A or Math 110, or have taken an equivalent linear algebra course at another college
- Have taken Data 8 or Data 100 or **both** Stat 20 and CS 61A

All of the requirements are enforced because the course has been designed specifically for students who have the above background in math, programming, and statistical inference. Students who have the math and programming background but not the inference should please consider EECS 126.  

### What is the best way to succeed in Prob 140? ###

Prob 140 is an upper division course that is primarily mathematical. Students are expected to have a corresponding degree of academic independence, discipline, and mathematical fluency. 

In all my courses I aim to make learning as efficient and enjoyable as possible. In particular, I try to make the lectures a great way to learn the material. So show up (there will be no videos) and ask lots of questions. A preparation guide is provided each week; it lists the reading and practice that students should do before attempting the week's assignments. These lists aren't just decoration. They are designed to be helpful. Homework will go faster if you've done the reading and some practice first.

But rather than reading more advice from me, listen to your fellow students instead. Here are quotes from student evaluations of the Fall 2019 course. They are from answers to the question "What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?" On the first day of class I show all of the responses to this question so you can see that the subset below is representative.

- Go to lecture and section. This is the most efficient way for you to learn this material. The more regularly you see the material in this class, the better you'll be at it. It's not worth ditching a lecture or discussion to go do something else (especially lecture) since catching up takes double the amount of time it would have if you had just gone. Trust me. This was in the course evaluations that I read when I started this class and I was a fool for not listening sometimes – don't be like me!
- Read the textbook!!! I've never read textbooks before this class because they're usually bad, but the textbook for this class was super helpful.
- The textbook is gold. The textbook is love. The textbook is everything. 
- And discussion sections were also really helpful as well because the staff is very knowledgeable and the questions we go over in section are relevant.
- If you need help, you will get it... the staff is truly fantastic. They not only want you to succeed, but they also prioritize in helping your intuition grow.
- Don't fall behind. It's easy to neglect a week of work and then just get the HW from a friend and what not and say "I'll come back to it later." Don't do that. You're hurting yourself. 
- The class will challenge you, especially if this is your first exposure to probability, but you will be stunned by how much you will come away with at the end of the semester. All you have to do is put the work in.
- If you're like me and your goal is to see what the least amount of work you can do in a class and still do well is, the answer in this class is to do all of it.
- This class is extremely time–consuming. This course is very difficult (not impossible), and designed so that you struggle your way through the material. Every single aspect of the lecture/lab/hw is meticulously designed, and it will be overwhelming. I would suggest taking this class at a time when you have the energy and willingness to dedicate serious time every week to the subject.
- This class is not as difficult as others describe it to be, but it is time–consuming and does require a lot of effort. As long as you do the homeworks, labs, and the review set problems, you should do fairly well in this course. Go to office hours if you get stuck on the homework, the TAs are really helpful. Make sure to take advantage of every resource offered, I wish I did at the beginning of the semester. Overall, this class is the most worthwhile course I have ever taken here at Berkeley. 

Over the past few semesters, students are increasingly pointing out that Prob 140 teaches them more than probability. Here are some excerpts from Fall 2019 evaluations.

- This class didn't just teach me probability theory, this class taught me algebra, calculus, linear algebra, geometry and probability theory.
- [Y]ou will see your ability to problem solve greatly improve. I think there is a decent size of students that feel awkward doing math – I'm one of them – and Prob 140 is a great course to introduce you into the problem solving skills required for upper division data science.
- More than the grade you have in this course, more than the grade you get on the exams, you will walk away with the ability to solve problems for yourself which is fundamentally more marketable, and far more important than the particular skillset you will learn in this class.
- I love how much confidence this course instills! Whenever I do interviews for Data Science roles now, I am always the most confident about the probability portion of the interviews.
- The material and coursework is life–changing because it's cool, but the collaboration you do with your peers is an entirely different beast. This course changed my perspective of Berkeley and collaboration so take advantage of working in teams and groups.
- DON'T be afraid to drop your old study habits and try out new study styles. This class gives you a great opportunity to learn how to learn and how YOU learn.
- I highly recommend anyone taking this class, as it teaches you not only probability, but also an ability to learn by yourself when you encounter something you cannot deal with at first glance.
